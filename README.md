# My year in data: a visual review of 2019

I tracked my activities for a year: then I visualized them.

If you lurk in the shadows too the data viz world, you’re no doubt familiar with this kind of exercise. Health and productivity apps offer more ways to track daily data than ever before. As people naturally obsessed with qunatifying, many data visualization practitioners have used it as an exercise in reflection. 

This was my 2019. It was the first year I decided to intentionally track activities like working out, computer productivity, and listening to music. Most notably I was inspired by the legendary Feltron reports. But at the time of starting the project, I was also still riding high off a recent foray into creative coding during the annual Codevember challenge. So I wanted an opportunity to focus my experience with this Javascript library back to data visualization and to push it’s limits into creating non-traditional charts and visualizations.

All sketches were created purely with code: Javascript and the p5.js library.
